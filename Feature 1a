I want the Support Request record to be created from within Opportunties and Account

Relationship to be maintained as follows
Account to Opportunity is 1:M
  Opportunity to Support Request is 1:M
  Account should be lookup on Support Request record so that I can create Support Request which is only Opportunity based.
  Every Support Request record should be mandatortily tied to an Opportunity
  Support Request should be a tab available
